1) From the scatter plot comparing Latitude to Temperature, you can verify that weather is warmer near equator and gets cooler as you move towards the poles.

2) Humidity is mostly higher across different Latitude while Cloudiness is spread all over and show no significant clustering hence there is no correlation.

3) Wind Speed is clustered mostly on the low end across x axis and can be deemed to have no relationship to Latitude.
